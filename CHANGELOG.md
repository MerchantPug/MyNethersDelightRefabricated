- First Release!
    
- This first release contains everything from 1.20.1-1.7.6.
  - Tags have been adjusted to match Farmer's Delight Refabricated.
  - Added tags for determining what plants can go on `resurgent_soil` and `resurgent_soil_farmland`.
    - These tags are: `does_not_survive/[block_name]` and `survives/[block_name]`.

TODO: REI and EMI support. I'll be doing these before a 1.21 port, but expect that to come at some point.
